Hi, I'm Sander!

I'm a developer. I build web- and iOS apps.

### More Information

I develop in **Ruby (on Rails)**, **JavaScript** and **RubyMotion**.
Sometimes I develop in **GO** or convert some code from **Objective-C** to *RubyMotion*.
<br>
I pick the technology that fits the problem at hand the best.
<br/>
I spend most of my time in the shell (**tmux**) writing code **Vim** on a 13 inch rundown *Macbook Pro*.
<br/>
