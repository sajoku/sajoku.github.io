Hi, I'm Sander!

I'm a developer. I build web- and iOS apps.

### More Information

I develop daily in **Ruby (on Rails)**, **JavaScript** and **RubyMotion**.
Sometimes I develop in **GO** or convert some code from **Objective-C** to *RubyMotion*.
I try to keep up with technology so I am learning **Clojure(Script)** and **Swift** in my sparetime.
<br/>
I spend most of my time in **(Mac)Vim** and shell on a 13 inch rundown *Macbook Pro*.
<br/>
