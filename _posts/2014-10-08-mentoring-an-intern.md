title: Mentoring an intern
---


A couple of months ago a colleague of mine asked me if I wanted to mentor a second-year student. The student will have a six month internship in which the student needs to learn some basic Ruby on Rails. The goal is to have the student be able to work on regular client projects by the end of the internship.

Being a mentor means more responsibility and the chance to teach someone my skills. Something I am really looking forward too. I made a list with some strong points and weaker ones. I'll highlight the ones I want to touch on.

Strong points:
* Pragmatic programmer
* Flexible
* Diverse

Weaker points:
* Unconvincing
* Insecure

I'll elaborate with an example. 
Most of the time I recognize we need to stray of the set path and use a different solution. Sometimes this means to not TDD but test after the fact. Sometimes this means writing an App in a different language.

I have a hard time convincing other people of solutions I implemented. 

{% highlight ruby %}
  def somemethod
    some stuff
  end
{% endhighlight %}
