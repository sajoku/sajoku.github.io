title: Input times easily by converting shorthand times
intro: Create timestamps from values like "10d" or "10d 2h 1m"

For a project I want to enter timestamps. But I want to make it fairly easy and
fast for the user to do this. There are a few users that are a bit more adept to
working with a console and so I figured entering times by hand would be awesome üöÄ.

This project works with bootstrap 4 so it already makes use of
bootstrap-timepicker. This means you'll get a nice popup and can select a date
time from there with your mouse.

The thing I'm after is being able to enter something like "10d" or "1d 12h" and
calculate what that would be in a timestamp. "10d" meaning today + 10 days.
1d 12h meaning today + 1 day + 12 hours.

I recently got into TypeScript and figured this would be a nice thing to make
with it. Here goes:

```typescript
declare var moment: any;
export class EasyTimeInput {
  datetimeInput: HTMLInputElement;
  regex = new RegExp(/([0-9]{1,3}[d,h])/gi);
  oneDayInMinutes = 1440;
  oneHourInMinutes = 60;
  oneMinute = 1;

  //Call this with `new EasyTimeInput(document.querySelector("input"))`
  constructor(inputElement: HTMLInputElement) {
    this.datetimeInput = inputElement;

    //check if the given input actually exists or do nothing
    if (this.datetimeInput) {
      this.listenToUserInput();
    }
  }

  //Listen to the blur event; If the input looses focus this triggers
  listenToUserInput() {
    this.datetimeInput.addEventListener("blur", () => {
      this.setCalculatedTime(this.datetimeInput);
    });
  }

  //receives the input element and changes the value
  setCalculatedTime(datetime: HTMLInputElement) {
    var calculatedTime = this.calculateTimeStamp(datetime.value);
    datetime.value = calculatedTime;
  }

  //calculates a new date and time based on the given value
  calculateTimeStamp(givenValue: string): string {
    var self = this;

    var minutesToAdd: number = 0;
    //Match against things like '10d 1h' or '1d' or '11m'
    var matches: string[] = givenValue.match(self.regex) || [];

    //loop through the matches and add the correct 'minutes' to the
    //result. For 1d this would do 1*1440
    Array.prototype.forEach.call(matches, function (match: any) {
      let multiplier = self.oneDayInMinutes;
      if (match.indexOf("h") !== -1) {
        multiplier = self.oneHourInMinutes;
      }
      if (match.indexOf("m") !== -1) {
        multiplier = self.oneMinute;
      }

      minutesToAdd += multiplier * parseInt(match);
    });

    //Create a new Date object and inject the time into it
    let newDateObj = new Date(new Date().getTime() + minutesToAdd * 60000);
    //return a new moment object formatted into a string
    return moment(newDateObj).format("DD-MM-YYYY HH:mm");
  }
}
```

disclaimer: There are some things specific to my environment
so this might not work for you.

The line `declare var moment: any;` is there as `moment` is a global variable in
this app. This makes it available to this class without having to import it.
